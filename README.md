# HMM-PC-Study
Code for running HMM and statistical analysis for the PC study detailed in Faber &amp; McIntosh (In preparation). To run the hidden Markov model (HMM) analysis, you will need the HMM-MAR Toolbox (Vidaurre et al., 2016) which you can find and clone here: https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR
To run the partial least squares (PLS) analysis, you'll need the PLSCMD toolbox, which you can download here: https://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/index.php?section=345
