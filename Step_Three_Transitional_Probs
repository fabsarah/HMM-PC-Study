%% Getting the Transitional Probability matrices manually
% this script uses the HMM toolbox function getMaskedTransProbMats.
% The input matrix (INPUT) is a task*participant cell matrix of the vpath,
% which you can get by dividing up the vpath you get from the HMM analysis
% by time. The output (OUTPUT) will be a task*participant cell matrix of
% transitional probability matrices with state persistence (the likelihood 
% of staying in-state)included: the diagonal numbers will not be zero!

%% First, if you didn't extract Xi in the original HMM, you can re-extract it here
% using the original output Gamma parameter
nrows = 5120; %the length of your original input data per cell
ncells = 792; %how many cells you had in your original input dta
Xi = approximateXi(Gamma,(nrows*ncells),hmm);
Rest_hmm12.Xi = Xi; %add it to the structure file

%% Now run the function
data = vpath;
T = ncells;%how many cells you had in your ORIGINAL long input cell array that went into HMM
testMask = 1:length(data);%Get the mask indices
Mask = reshape(testMask,[],T)';%reshape them task-wise
outMask = num2cell(Mask,2); %convert the Mask indices to a cell
[P,Pi] = getMaskedTransProbMats(test,T*nrows,hmm,outMask,Gamma,Xi);%get the matrices

Rest_hmm12.TPT.TPT_P = TPT_P;%the state*state matrix
Rest_hmm12.TPT.TPT_Pi = TPT_Pi;%each state's weight
clear nrows ncells
